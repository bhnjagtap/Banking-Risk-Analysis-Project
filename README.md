# Bank Customer Data Analysis  

## üìå Project Overview  
This project demonstrates a complete **data analysis workflow**, starting from **Excel data**, importing it into **MySQL**, performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Python**, and finally building an **interactive Power BI dashboard** to visualize customer insights.  

The goal of this project is to uncover hidden patterns in customer financial data and provide data-driven insights that can help in **customer segmentation, account management, and business decision-making**.

## üìÇ Workflow  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Source (Excel)  
- Initial dataset was provided in **Excel format (.xlsx)** containing customer account details.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Import into MySQL  
- The Excel dataset was imported into **MySQL** for structured data management.  
- Connected MySQL with Jupyter Notebook using the `mysql.connector` package:  


import mysql.connector

# Connect to server
cnx = mysql.connector.connect(
    host="127.0.0.1",
    port=3306,
    user="mike",
    password="s3cre3t!"
)
### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Python  
Performed detailed **EDA** to understand relationships between variables, identify patterns, and detect correlations.  

#### üîé Key Insights from EDA:  
- The strongest **positive correlation** is among:  
  - **Bank Deposits** with **Checking Accounts**, **Saving Accounts**, and **Foreign Currency Accounts**.  
- This indicates that customers who maintain **high balances in one account type** often hold **substantial funds across other account types as well**.  
- Such insights are valuable for **customer profiling** and identifying **high-value customers**.  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Power BI Dashboard  
Designed an **interactive dashboard** in **Power BI** to present the insights visually.  

#### The dashboard highlights:  
- **Account distributions**  
- **Correlations** between different account types  
- **Trends and customer patterns** for business use
